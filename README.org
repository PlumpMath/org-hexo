#+TITLE: org-hexo -- org-mode exporter for Hexo

org-hexo is an org-mode exporter for [[https://hexo.io/zh-tw/][hexio]] static site generator. I write
this for my personal's [[http://coldnew.github.io][blog]].

* *TODO*

  Add full workable examples.
  
  Currently I use [[https://github.com/coldnew/emacs-blogit][emacs-blogit]] to export the org file to =source/_posts= dir. It's time to integrate all to org-hexo.

* Backend

org-hexo support following backend, which help you convert org-mode article to another type file

- [X] Markdown

  It might work, but it may have problem when you enable =htmlize=, so this feature will move to use HTML backend

- [X] HTML

  Now I use this :)

* OPTIONS

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+OPTIONS:  feed:nil
#+END_SRC
